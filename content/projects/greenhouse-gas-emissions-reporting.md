# Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reporting Framework

## Project Overview

At Dewberry, I led the development of a comprehensive greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reporting framework specifically designed for public sector clients, establishing a standardized approach to emissions measurement, monitoring, and reporting.

## Challenge

Public sector clients are at the forefront of climate change adaptation and mitigation measures and projects as the front
line for the average citizen. These public sector clients often do not have the internal staff, resources, and expertise
necessary to build, from scratch, a data colleciton, analysis, and reporting pipleine.

## Solution

I developed a holistic GHG emissions reporting framework that included:

- **Methodology Selection**: Evaluation and selection of appropriate GHG accounting methodologies aligned with international standards such as the Greenhouse Gas Protocol
- **Emissions Scope Definition**: Clear delineation of Scope 1 (direct), Scope 2 (indirect energy), and Scope 3 (value chain) emissions sources relevant to transit operations
- **Data Collection Protocols**: Propose the development of standardized data collection procedures and templates
- **Calculation Tools**: Implementation of industry specific tools for accurate emissions quantification
- **Reporting Templates**: Design of comprehensive yet accessible reporting formats for various stakeholders

## Implementation

The implementation process involved:

1. **Pilot Testing**: Initial deployment with select transportation clients to refine the methodology
2. **Documentation**: Creation of detailed guidance documents and standard operating procedures
3. **Verification**: Establishment of quality assurance procedures to ensure data accuracy

## Results

The GHG emissions reporting framework delivered significant benefits:

- **Standardization**: Established a consistent reporting standard across multiple transportation agencies
- **Data Quality**: Improved the accuracy and reliability of emissions data
- **Strategic Planning**: Provided a foundation for evidence-based emissions reduction strategies
- **Transparency**: Enhanced the ability of transportation agencies to communicate their environmental performance to stakeholders

## Conclusion

This project represents an important contribution to the sustainability efforts of public transportation agencies. By establishing a robust framework for GHG emissions reporting, I've helped clients not only measure their current environmental impact but also identify opportunities for emissions reduction and track progress toward their climate goals.
